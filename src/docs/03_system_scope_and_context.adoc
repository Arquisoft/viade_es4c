== System Scope and Context

The scope of our project is a website where the users can create, explore and share routes without the related data being stored on a third-party server. So, a sharing website where all the shared data belongs to the private server of each user making use of SOLID. 

Each user will be able to import new routes through GeoJSON or GPX files, save them on their PODs and share them with their friends.
The shared routes will have titles, descriptions and attached media.

The application will be able to load and show routes made with similar apps.


=== Business Context

A user can store routes of various types that will be kept in his POD. He can also share the routes  and other type of files with their friends

	* Regular user: Stores his own routes.
	* Sender: Sends routes to other user
	* Receiver user: Receives notifications containing routes from other user.
	* Pod: Each user has a POD where the routes and the shared information are stored.
	* Viade: Decentralized application to store routes and share with other people.

The descentralized server system of the application will make use of SOLID storing all the user's data on their respective PODs. This will be integrated through the use of React, which will be the library of Javascript used to make all the interfaces of the application. An important key in the interaction and manageability of the web when communicating with the users will be the maps, which will be offered making use of OpenStreetMaps API.
