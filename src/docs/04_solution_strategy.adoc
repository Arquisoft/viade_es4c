== Solution Strategy

Viade is a decentralized route management system based on the Solid specifications.

=== Technology decisions

==== Libraries

- https://react-bootstrap.github.io/[React Bootstrap] : To implement the layout of our application
- https://github.com/inrupt/solid-react-components[Solid React Components] :To help with some of the POD features (login, registration, friends list)
- https://github.com/jeff-zucker/solid-file-client[Solid-File-Client] : To access POD resources
- https://github.com/jeff-zucker/sparql-fiddle[sparql-fiddle] : 
To query data stored in PODs.
- https://leafletjs.com/[Leaflet] and https://www.openstreetmap.org/[OpenStreetMap] : To display the routes on a map
- https://jestjs.io/[Jest] : Testing
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify[Toastify]:  :To display information to the users
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpxparser[GPXParser]: To help manage GPX-formatted routes

==== Languages
- Javascript
- CSS
- SPARQL

==== Other decisions

- We support GPX and GeoJSON(LineString) formats.
- NodeJs to implement the Solid server
- Using the Solid recommendations and specifications

=== Organizational decisions

To develop this project we designed a workflow that would ensure flexibility and consistency.
The new functionalities would be selected each week in reunions, those new characteristics would be develop alone or in pairs and they should be feasible to finish in one week.

Each feature would be supervised and/or adapted by one of the coordinators, we will have two, one for the front-end and one for the back-end.
Below that we decided some extra specializations to optimize our strengths and time.

Although all members have contributed to almost all parts of the implementation, the overall distribution is:

- Rut Alfonso Garcia, in charge of the decisions about file formats and the parsers.

- Carlos Menchaca Mosteiro, mostly dedicated to POD and file loading issues.

- Manuel Lorenzo Vega, file uploading and directory management from the client side.

- Daniel Pancho Cueto, specialized in the testing and quality assurance.

- Christian Peláez Fernández, back-end coordinator and specialist of the SPARQL queries.

- Carmen Sirgo Lopez, back-end and front-end bridge defining all its communication.

- Ricardo Soto Estévez, front-end coordinator and UI/UX designer.
